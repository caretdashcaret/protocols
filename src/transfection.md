Transfection
=============

Transfection is a delicate process. Reminder to practice sterile technique such
spray everything with alcohol before placing into the hood and avoid placing hands over open plates.

Prepare Vectors (Bench)
------------------------

* Create a vector mix for each reaction in eppendorf tubes
  * 25ng EBFP (to measure activation against)
  * 60ng reporter (to measure activation)
  * 10ng guide
  * 200ng Cas9 construct
* Prepare enough so you can duplicate each reaction (making doubles) in the same tube
* 6uL of master mix per sample (3uL for each reaction)

Create Liposomes (Hood)
------------------------

* 2uL lipofectamine per transfection
* Prepare a lipofectamine master mix in a 5mL tube (large conical tubes)
  * 72uL lipofectamine
  * 1800uL OptiMEM (light pink in color)
* Mix and vortex the lipofectamine master mix
* Wait for 5 minutes
* Add 100uL of lipofectamine master mix to reach vector mix eppendorf
* Vortex and spin down the eppendorf
* Wait 30 minutes for liposomes to form

Change Cell Media (Hood)
-------------------------

While waiting for liposomes, change media of cells

* Use glass pipette to aspirate out media
  * Tap side of metal container for easier release of glass pipettes
  * Connect pipette to rubber tube
  * Turn yellow knob counterclockwise to start vacuuming
  * Tilt plate towards you for easier aspiration

* Deposit 0.5mL of DMEM (Eagle Serum) into each well
  * Use 10mL pipette to aspirate a lot, and then deposit 0.5mL

* Label each well of plate with their corresponding reaction

Transfection (Hood)
--------------------

* Deposit 50uL of the transfection mix (vectors mix + lipofectamine mix) to each well
  * Close lid and plate gently
* Return plate to warm oven
