BP Reaction
===============

A type of Gateway Cloning

Protocol
--------

* Normalize all gel extracted PCR products to 150ng/ul
  * If they are lower than that it is fine just use them as is
  * Do not add more to compensate

For each reaction

* Add 0.5ul of gel extracted PCR product
* Add 0.5ul of pDonr221 vector
* Add 1ul of TE pH 8.0
  * Use dedicated TE to avoid contamination
    * There is a special bottle of this on Alex's shelf
* Add 0.5ul of BP Clonase
  * BP Clonase is stored at -80C
  * Add last
* Pipette up and down

For all samples

* Vortex samples
* Spin down
* Leave on bench overnight for reaction

Next Steps
-----------

* Transform reaction products
  * Can store reaction products at -20C to retransform, if need be
* Plate on LB+Kan
* Pick 3 colonies each
* Sequence with M13F(-21) and M13rev from Genewiz
