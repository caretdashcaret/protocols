Transformatiom
===============

Transform DNA into E. Coli

Protocol
--------

* Thaw `C2987` competent cells on ice
* Grab a cold block and place labelled PCR tubes in cold block

For each reaction

* Aliqout 11uL of competent cells into labelled PCR tube
* Add 1uL of DNA

Once completed

* Move PCR tubes to thermocyler and start transformation protocol
  * Start transformation protocol first and wait for the temperature to lower before loading
  * Thermocycler protocol:
    * 30 minutes at 0C
    * 30 seconds at 42C
    * 5 minutes at 0C (plus infinite hold)

For outgrowth, for each sample

* Add 550uL SOC to eppendorf tube
* Transfer each sample to eppendorf tube
* Incubate in shaker at 37C for 1 hour

For plating

* Plate 80uL of each sample on to appropriate antibiotic plate


Notes
------
* Store outgrowth at 2C (-20C will kill them)
