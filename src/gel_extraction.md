Extraction
----------

* Excise the appropriate band and place into 2mL tubes

For each sample (based on commercial gel extraction protocol):

* Add 1200uL QG to dissolve (should be based on gel volume, but 1200uL is good enough)
* Place tubes in 50C shaking block for 10 minutes
* Aspirate 700uL of dissolved gel solution into Zymo column
  * Spin at 15000rpm
* Repeat by aspirating another 700uL of dissolved gel into Zymo column and spin
* Add 600uL PE to Zymo column for wash
  * Spin at 6000rpm to remove PE
  * Empty liquid collector and spin at 150000rpm to clean remaining PE from column
* Add 20uL EB for final elution
